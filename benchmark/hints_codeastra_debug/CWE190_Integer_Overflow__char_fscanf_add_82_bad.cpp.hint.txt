The code snippet demonstrates a potential integer overflow vulnerability in C++. The vulnerability occurs when the 'fscanf' function is used to read data from the console and the data read is added to a variable without checking its size. This can lead to an integer overflow if the data read is larger than the variable can hold.

The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to validate input data before performing arithmetic operations.
