NULL pointer dereference is a common security issue where a program attempts to access memory that has not been properly initialized. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even security vulnerabilities.

In this case, the code may pass a NULL pointer to a virtual method, which can result in a NULL pointer dereference. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

To fix this issue, the code should check for NULL pointers before attempting to access them. This can be done using a simple null check or using smart pointers like unique_ptr or shared_ptr.
