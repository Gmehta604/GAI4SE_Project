The code is using a template generated by a tool, so it's not possible to fix it manually without understanding the context of the tool and the specific vulnerability being addressed. However, I can provide some general guidance on how to fix similar issues in C/C++ code.

The issue with this code is that it dereferences a null pointer (`data`) without checking if it's null first. This is a common vulnerability known as a null pointer dereference. To fix it, you should check if `data` is null before attempting to use it.

Here's an example of how the code could be modified to fix the vulnerability:
```c
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    char* data = nullptr;

    // ...

    if (data != nullptr) {
        std::cout << "Data: " << data << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Data is null!" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we first declare a variable `data` and set it to `nullptr`. We then check if `data` is null before attempting to use it. If `data` is null, we output a message indicating that it's null. Otherwise, we output the value of `data`.

Note that this is just one way to fix the vulnerability. Depending on the context of the code and the specific requirements, there may be other ways to fix it.
